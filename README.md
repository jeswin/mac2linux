# mac2linux

The goal of this project is to document settings that make macOS mimic Ubuntu LTS + Gnome, especially the shortcuts. PRs welcome for other distros.

# Usage

Choose one of the following methods:
1. [Simple approach](Simple.md) - doesn't require installing a keyboard remapping tool
2. [Advanced approach with Karabiner Elements](Karabiner.md) - for advanced users; requires installing Karabiner Elements

We recommend the Advanced approach for power users, as it gets much closer to the default Linux experience.

# Limitations

PRs welcome to fix these limitations

- Only targets the latest Ubuntu LTS (22.04)

- Currently this works best for people who have already mapped Caps Lock to Control on Linux - it mimics similar behavior by mapping Caps Lock to Command on macOS.
  When Caps Lock is mapped to Control (on Linux), seldom would you use the original Control key at the bottom; hence freeing the original key up to emulate the Super Key on Linux.

- There may be a bias towards typical right handed usage.

NOTE: This is work in progress!
